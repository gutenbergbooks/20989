<h2><i>PREFACE</i></h2>


<p><i>As many were not able to secure all the Acts of
"A Comedy of Errors" owing to the editions having
been exhausted, and as numerous friends have expressed
a desire to secure it entire, the author has
concluded to publish it, supplemented by four more
recent compositions.</i></p>

<p><i>With malice towards none and charity to all,
this modest booklet is launched on the uncertain sea
of literature.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><i>Scene: &nbsp;&nbsp;Throne Room at the Capitol</i></p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>  Most noble Francos, I greet thee heartily.</p>
<p> A function truly noble falls within thy grasp;</p>
<p> And thou wilt with it deal as only sages can.</p>
<p> The distant Isles are now crushed by the pow'r</p>
<p> Of ruthless tyrants, who on plunder bent,</p>
<p> Oppress a helpless, but a worthy race,</p>
<p> Which groans beneath a yoke of foreign make,</p>
<p> And hence it fitteth not the sable necks</p>
<p> On which it now, relentless, firmly rests.</p>
<p class="i2"> 'Tis well, we know, how, filled with visions vain,</p>
<p class="i2"> Our predecessor sought to stuff those minds</p>
<p class="i2"> With mental food fit only for those born</p>
<p class="i2"> To skins of whiter tint, and hence with grasp</p>
<p class="i2"> Of firmer structure, built by kindly Time,</p>
<p class="i2"> Who fashioned us in more ennobled mold;</p>
<p class="i2"> While power divine to cap the climax grand,</p>
<p class="i2"> With hand so deft, gave it its final touch.</p>
<p> These men with vision faint who planned so vain</p>
<p> Knew not the knightly thought bred in the south.</p>
<p> The north winds chill and stunt the subtle power</p>
<p> Which flourishes alone 'neath southern skies,</p>
<p> To read unerring from the page of truth</p>
<p> That God has fashioned some to mount aloft,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[page&nbsp;6]</span>
<p> While others grovel on a lower plane.</p>
<p class="i2"> Hence we must cherish ever in our hearts,</p>
<p class="i2"> The thought that pigment marks the subtle line;</p>
<p class="i2"> And so throw off a burden on us laid</p>
<p class="i2"> By those who blindly cast their shoulders down,</p>
<p class="i2"> To bear a load which deep ingratitude</p>
<p class="i2"> Alone will be the recompense for all our pains.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> My liege, I grasp the thought: a burden dark,</p>
<p> Which now each year a golden tribute calls,</p>
<p> Must be disposed of quickly, but so sly</p>
<p> That watching nations may not fling a slur</p>
<p> Upon our honor as we cast adrift</p>
<p> This alien race to face the world alone.</p>
<p><span class="outdent2a"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Francos, truly thou hast quick discerned</p>
<p class="i2"> The thought which wisdom fathered in my mind.</p>
<p class="i2"> "Be wise as serpent, harmless as the dove,"</p>
<p class="i2"> Should be our watchword as we scuttle ship,</p>
<p class="i2"> For there be those who speak with venomed tongues</p>
<p class="i2"> Of serpents, as we cast them helpless off.</p>
<p class="i2"> But if we of politicos make use,</p>
<p class="i2"> And to their clamour lend approving smile,</p>
<p class="i2"> We may while coolly thrusting them aside,</p>
<p class="i2"> Meet with the thoughtless world's approving nod.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Ha! Ha! methinks I see my path made clear</p>
<p> 'Twere wise to fellowship with only those</p>
<p> Who, longing for the flesh pots, lend their aid</p>
<p> To further us in this our deep design.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold! Francos, hold! The very walls have ears.</p>
<p class="i2"> Suspicion once aroused our game is up</p>
<p class="i2"> In silence let our worthy scheme mature;</p>
<p class="i2"> An utterance unwise may spell defeat.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Most noble Caesar, thou at wisdom's fount</p>
<p> Hast drunk until the fountain hath run dry.</p>
<p> I ready stand to follow each command</p>
<p> Ignoring every judgment of mine own.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I before the gods did minister,</p>
<p class="i2"> I learned that strategy cured many ills;</p>
<p class="i2"> And when Parnassus high I made my throne,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[page&nbsp;7]</span>
<p class="i2"> I found it well to wield an iron hand.</p>
<p class="i2"> And now to work our pleasure in these Isles,</p>
<p class="i2"> 'Twere best to blend these methods in our scheme,</p>
<p class="i2"> Whilst thou with honeyed tongue shall words employ</p>
<p class="i2"> The callow forum shall my will obey.</p>
<p class="i2"> But silence! put a padlock on thy tongue;</p>
<p class="i2"> A word unspoken never worketh harm.</p>
<p class="i2"> While he who babbles layeth down his shield,</p>
<p class="i2"> And thus an enemy may work his death.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Mine ears are open to thine every word,</p>
<p> Would that they could but hear in distant Isles;</p>
<p> For when I beard the lion in his den,</p>
<p> Thy potent thoughts were then a healing balm.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sayest well, Francos, but lend an ear;</p>
<p> Avoid our enemies; they counsel ill.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(To Page)</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;But, page, entreat sweet Quezox to attend</p>
<p> While we in converse measure every act.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Enter Quezox:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Most honored sire, I come at thy command,</p>
<p> And wait your pleasure; if by any means</p>
<p> My words, convincing, can this matter solve:</p>
<p> The land that bore me bids me loud proclaim.</p>
<p> So we consider wisely, let us call</p>
<p> The Commoner, whose wisdom is renowned.</p>
<p> That he may with us weigh each tangled point,</p>
<p> And thus make our solution doubly sure.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Quezox, caution is a precious thing.</p>
<p class="i2"> And while 'tis known that council oft is wise,</p>
<p class="i2"> Yet it were better Wilhelm were left out</p>
<p class="i2"> For he hath visions which from tender plants</p>
<p class="i2"> To forest monarchs grow, with roots so deep</p>
<p class="i2"> Emplanted in the soil, that naught can stir.</p>
<p class="i2"> Beside, financial ills have him beset,</p>
<p class="i2"> And he now eager, filthy lucre seeks.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Most honored sire, I would from Quezox learn</p>
<p> What stern encounters I must early meet.</p>
<p> He from the first did see the canker grow</p>
<p> And hath a remedy, methinks, conceived.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, Quezox, speak! and free thy surging mind.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page&nbsp;8]</span>
<p class="i2"> For well I know abuses rankle there.</p>
<p class="i2"> Our enemies politic, firm entrenched,</p>
<p class="i2"> Have borne with heavy hand upon thy race.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Quezox:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah noble sire, how well thy mind conceives</p>
<p> The ills which bear my hapless people down.</p>
<p> Much learning fits thee for the ruler's seat</p>
<p> And keen discernment flashes from thine eye.</p>
<p> There pigmies move within a circle charmed</p>
<p> And fatten on rich spoils with cruel glee.</p>
<p> They force their alien ways with tyrant hands</p>
<p> Upon my people; and with cold disdain</p>
<p> Refuse our council, when 'twere meet and wise.</p>
<p> I beg thee, cast them out, both root and branch</p>
<p> And clean official nests from grafty filth.</p>
<p> Our patriots, able, then can claim their own</p>
<p> And on the ruins build a blissful state.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most noble Quezox, thou hast touched the sore.</p>
<p class="i2"> In Francos thou wilt find a helping hand,</p>
<p class="i2"> Council him wise for he the subtle wiles</p>
<p class="i2"> Of crafty scheming men may not discern.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Quezox:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, noble sir, if I advice may breathe,</p>
<p> It were to shun the brood of vultures well.</p>
<p> They're skilled indeed to sing the siren's song,</p>
<p> And play with flattery on honest minds.</p>
<p> I feel 'twere well to journey to these Isles</p>
<p> In company with Francos, at thy will,</p>
<p> Thus guarding him from every idle tongue,</p>
<p> Which might make impress on an open heart.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Quezox, thou art wise, it shall be done.</p>
<p class="i2"> And as you journey, meditate and plan</p>
<p class="i2"> To lop off every head that blocks thy way,</p>
<p class="i2"> Or lacks in sympathy for thy great work.</p>
<p class="i2"> For Francos hath been trained for civic life</p>
<p class="i2"> Where virtue reigns and intrigue hath no place.</p>
<p class="i2"> But with thine aid and to guide a fearless soul,</p>
<p class="i2"> And Tammany his pattern, all were well.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Great Caesar, trust me well; I smell the rot</p>
<p class="i4"> that distance cannot smother, and will clean</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page&nbsp;9]</span>
<p> The halls of state, and there implant true men.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And silence! speak nor write not idle words,</p>
<p class="i2"> For they are often swords which cleave the soul;</p>
<p class="i2"> When enemies who wield a cunning hand</p>
<p class="i2"> Shall thrust them back, and laugh in gleeful scorn.</p>
<p class="i2"> E'en I regret what in an idle hour,</p>
<p class="i2"> I thoughtless paged regarding freedom's gift.</p>
<p class="i2"> And now they sting me, sting me to the soul.</p>
<p class="i2"> Oh that I ne'er had penned such childish thoughts!</p>
<p class="i2"> Hence hold thy tongue or honeyed words proclaim</p>
<p class="i2"> Which may mean little or perchance mean much.</p>
<p class="i2"> And now farewell, and hie thee on thy way:</p>
<p class="i2"> Again I say a padlock on thy tongue.</p>
<p><span class="outdent2a"><i>Quezox and Francos moving backward, and making obeisances.</i></span></p>
<p> Adieu, most noble Caesar, since the time</p>
<p> When Washington first donned the regal crown.</p>
<p> We'll smoke the woodchucks out and tan their hides</p>
<p> And parchment make, on which, in words of gold,</p>
<p> Shall be inscribed, so all the world may read:</p>
<p> "Saturnine pleasure it to us doth give,</p>
<p> To see them walk the plank from scuttled ship."</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha Ha! but speak it not aloud, until 'tis done.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Both:</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whist! whist as mice! We'll oil the guillotine.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p class="i2"> <i>Exeunt both while Caesar washes his hands with

<hr />


<p class="ind"><i>Scene: &nbsp;&nbsp; On shipboard</i></p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(Quezox, slowly walking the deck, soliloquizes.)</i></span></p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p> I feel a mighty task doth bear me down.</p>
<p> When distance held the burden in its hand,</p>
<p> It seemed, that, like a vessel on the stock,</p>
<p> 'Twould easy, when the holding blocks were moved,</p>
<p> Slip gently down into the sea of states;</p>
<p> But now that nearness stares me in the face,</p>
<p> Wearing prophetic grin, methinks, I see</p>
<p> Deep obstacles which bar the slippery ways,</p>
<p> On which the ship must glide to waters deep.</p>
<p class="i2"> A ship to safely sail in troubled seas,</p>
<p class="i2"> Must boast a captain skilled in wat'ry lore.</p>
<p class="i2"> But he were helpless, if the vessel's crew</p>
<p class="i2"> Have not the cunning which of years is born.</p>
<p class="i2"> Alas, from out the black and threat'ning sky,</p>
<p class="i2"> One star alone of all the eyes of Night</p>
<p class="i2"> Doth faintly pierce the gloom and light our way</p>
<p class="i2"> To safe solution of the knotty point.</p>
<p> If but the Captain wear a stately mien</p>
<p> And walketh deck with slow and kingly tread,</p>
<p> Lieutenants skilled, by filthy lucre bribed,</p>
<p> May box the compass and so save the ship.</p>
<p> But who shall Captain be? Ah there's the rub.</p>
<p> There many be who fain would walk the deck,</p>
<p> Though he who bears the burdens of day</p>
<p> Forsooth should then be decked with laurel crown.</p>
<p class="i2"> But there be schemers, working in the dark,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[page&nbsp;11]</span>
<p class="i2"> Who ready stand to grasp the hanging fruit</p>
<p class="i2"> While he who plants and watereth the tree</p>
<p class="i2"> With itching jaws may ne'er its fruitage taste.</p>
<p class="i2"> Caesar hath said that Francos aid will lend,</p>
<p class="i2"> To further us in working our designs,</p>
<p class="i2"> And yet fear whispers to mine anxious mind</p>
<p class="i2"> Honor hath made his soul its dwelling place.</p>
<p> Hence "graft," even to aid his upward climb</p>
<p> To higher honors, findeth not his ear.</p>
<p> As he hath gold, methinks the chink of coin</p>
<p> Charmeth him not; belike 'twould poorer men.</p>
<p> As skilled musician fingereth the harp,</p>
<p> So must I play upon his prejudice,</p>
<p> Which finds no virtue in politic foes,</p>
<p> And thus shall shrewdness do its perfect work.</p>
<p> But Seldonskip? I love this hombre not.</p>
<p> He looketh on our race with proud disdain,</p>
<p> Hence I with poison must sour Francos' mind,</p>
<p> That he but vileness in this boor shall see.</p>
<p class="i2"> Some men, I ween, would tread in virtue's path,</p>
<p class="i2"> Unless strong passion, born of love intense,</p>
<p class="i2"> Should goad them to stretch out a greedy hand,</p>
<p class="i2"> And grasp from beauty's bough forbidden fruit.</p>
<p class="i2"> For lechery, like plaster o'er the walls,</p>
<p class="i2"> They have no tolerance within their souls:</p>
<p class="i2"> But there are those who will stalk any game.</p>
<p class="i2"> Nor like myself, do they beauty demand.</p>
<p class="i2"> If matters not if but the figure wears</p>
<p class="i2"> Garb feminine, they'll ready take the scent,</p>
<p class="i2"> And like to well trained hounds leave not the trail</p>
<p class="i2"> Until the quarry is at length run down.</p>
<p> And this I must apply to Francos' ear,</p>
<p> Thus breeding deep contempt, clothed with distrust,</p>
<p> For him who puketh up a sour disdain,</p>
<p> From stomach filled with racial prejudice,</p>
<p> That shall his downfall speed, helped by the spleen,</p>
<p> Which pampered youth, fed with a golden spoon,</p>
<p> Must ever show, whene'er its will is crossed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[page&nbsp;12]</span>
<p class="i2"> And thus will I proceed to "cook his goose,"</p>
<p class="i2"> Until the flesh shall cleave from off its bones.</p>
<p class="i2"> But as it seemeth to my anxious mind,</p>
<p class="i2"> I read uncertainty in Francos' eye,</p>
<p class="i2"> "The welfare of thy people" once he voiced,</p>
<p class="i2"> Such words make music not unto mine ear.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(Disdainfully)</i></span></p>
<p> "Thy people!" So it is that Francos speaks.</p>
<p> Ah! little do the workings of his mind</p>
<p> Discern that we who seek the pow'r to rule</p>
<p> Feel not the Tao blood coursing our veins.</p>
<p> For it by stain Caucasian is submerged;</p>
<p> Still, we a ladder make of sable backs,</p>
<p> To climb aloft into the chairs of state.</p>
<p> Exampling thus: "The fittest must survive".</p>
<p class="i2"> A narrow man, though cast in honest mould,</p>
<p class="i2"> May mischief work, while conscience wears a smile.</p>
<p class="i2"> To Francos' I would dare not ope my heart,</p>
<p class="i2"> So I must feel my way with catlike tread,</p>
<p class="i2"> And strive with minor things to stuff him full,</p>
<p class="i2"> So points of import shall his mind escape.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos</i></span> <i>(drawing near):</i></p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p> 'Tis done! The die indeed is safely cast.</p>
<p> And Wisdom smiles, while seated on her throne.</p>
<p> 'Twere well to kill two birds with one shrewd fling</p>
<p> Of fortune's stone, and thus from grievous ills</p>
<p> Which close enwrapped by robes of custom, are</p>
<p> Work freedom from the threats of cruel fate.</p>
<p> Francos, whose mental woof is frail indeed,</p>
<p> Stood for promotion to important post.</p>
<p> Which might embarrass all the wheels of state,</p>
<p> And so 'twere well within his itching hand</p>
<p> To place commission for those distant Isles</p>
<p> Where mild efficiency can work no harm.</p>
<p> 'Tis strange that Francos in the halls of state</p>
<p> So long hath squatted, in a chair too big,</p>
<p> But still much gold can smooth a thorny path</p>
<p> And work discovery of hidden worth.</p>
<p> With modest mental gifts, but gentle mien</p>
<p> He ill is fitted for promotion here.</p>
<p> But it were matter of but little weight</p>
<p> With Quezox as a mentor at his side,</p>
<p> What he shall fashion in his pigmy state,</p>
<p> For squirt from wisdom's fount can quench each flame.</p>
<p> But Quezox? Can I trust this sable knight?</p>
<p> He speaketh soft, but lurking in each smile</p>
<p> Methinks I spy a double meaning there.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[page&nbsp;18]</span>
<p> 'Twere well to bring Dame Caution to the front</p>

<p> For he, while fat with wisdom, may of guile</p>
<p> Be deeply feeding, and from stomach weak</p>
<p> May spew deep discord when we least expect.</p>
<p> I have it! well 'tis known that Wisdom's bird,</p>
<p> While winging daily flight, hath hovered o'er</p>
<p> Our foes politic, and hath often shunned</p>
<p> To make her nest in Democratic boughs.</p>
<p> 'Twere well to seek from out the tricky foe</p>
<p> One who shall balance, like the flying wheel,</p>
<p> The various acts of Francos and his crew</p>
<p> And so most shrewdly curb the critic tongues</p>
<p> That wag within the jaws of foes most keen,</p>
<p> Thus hiding well, from all the thoughtless world.</p>
<p> The deep intent which labors in our breast.</p>
<p> And which in time shall like the bird encased</p>
<p> By brittle shell, break forth and fly aloft,</p>
<p> Singing to startled worlds sweet freedom's song.</p>
<p> But woe is me! My mem'ry playeth false,</p>
<p> For he of ponderous girth, in Island home</p>
<p> Seeketh to grow more fat on public swill.</p>
<p> And he presumeth, justly too, on what</p>
<p> His silver tongue did work to boost me on.</p>
<p> But still, lean men are best for action keen,</p>
<p> For too much fatness burdeneth the mind</p>
<p> And speaks in trumpet tones of strong desire</p>
<p> For pleasures, and mayhap for cards and wine.</p>
<p> And so 'twere best to know this Falstaff not</p>
<p> For pow'r politic ne'er can from his hand</p>
<p> Against me work dire mischief, for his tongue</p>
<p> Is locked securely by our party key.</p>
<p> But I must call the lightning to mine aid,</p>
<p> And order him who now bemoans his fate,</p>
<p> To scan the bailiwick for pots and pans,</p>
<p> That Francos no discomfort may incur.</p>
<p> For he so long in Fate's kind lap hath lain,</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos (Soliloquizes):</i></span> Methinks the poet of the past who scrolled</p>
<p> "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"</p>
<p> Indeed were wise and kenned whereof he wrote.</p>
<p> His keen imagination doth amaze</p>
<p> And fill my mind with wonder at his full</p>
<p> Discernment of the most unhappy lot</p>
<p> Which great responsibility doth load</p>
<p> Upon the shoulders of betroubled men</p>
<p> Whom fate relentless hath before ordained</p>
<p> To, like the pack-horse, patiently, each day,</p>
<p> Upbear most galling burden, born of cares</p>
<p> Which do encompass the affairs of state.</p>
<p> When in the Nation's forum I did sit,</p>
<p> Like to a minnow in a mighty pool,</p>
<p> I did disport, and, nourishing no care,</p>
<p> Found naught to mar the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pleausures'">pleasures</ins> born each day.</p>
<p> But now there looms before me mountain high</p>
<p> Questions of mighty import to the state</p>
<p> Which I must quickly and with wisdom solve</p>
<p> Without the bell mare's chime to charm mine ear.</p>
<p class="i2"> On whose sound judgment dare I now rely?</p>
<p class="i2"> Whose honor, on grave issues, can I trust?</p>
<p class="i2"> Shall I use Quezox blindly as a staff</p>
<p class="i2"> On which to lean, as on my path I grope?</p>
<p class="i2"> Or shall I ope' mine ear to those entrenched</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[page&nbsp;24]</span>
<p class="i2"> Behind official desks, with knowledge armed</p>
<p class="i2"> And primed for combat, when I shall disclose</p>
<p class="i2"> The policy profound, by wisdom sired?</p>
<p> Alas, I find that I must war with friends,</p>
<p> Who seem enamored with the tricky foe,</p>
<p> And by long contact they infected be</p>
<p> By doctrines both heretical and vile.</p>
<p class="i2"> Of those who legal robbery do make</p>
<p class="i2"> A vehicle to stuff their bellies full</p>
<p class="i2"> I must beware; for it doth to me seem</p>
<p class="i2"> That long and double squinting at the law</p>
<p class="i2"> Impairs their moral sight for all but fees;</p>
<p class="i2"> Hence deep entanglements might be the goal</p>
<p class="i2"> To which their slimy tongues would shrewdly guide</p>
<p class="i2"> That from disturbance, they might profit reap.</p>
<p> Alas, what to me seemed but pigmy state</p>
<p> Now looms up mightily before mine eye,</p>
<p> And like the feathered mother with her brood</p>
<p> Must I my many cares each day enwing</p>
<p> And from the circling hawk with hungry eye</p>
<p> Protect and shelter, till mature, they grow.</p>
<p> But this commission! We must shrewd select</p>
<p> Such pliant men as will our pleasure work;</p>
<p> For we ken not what yeast in working deep</p>
<p> Within the inexperienced minds of those</p>
<p> Foregath'ring soon to fashion laws to meet</p>
<p> The pressing needs of our embarrassed state.</p>
<p> I feel mayhap, that seeds of self were sown</p>
<p> Within the willing hearts of those who long</p>
<p> Have profit made at this poor State's expense;</p>
<p> Which seeds have grown into a mighty tree</p>
<p> That hides behind its fol'age justice sweet</p>
<p> So deep within those shades that e'en the sun</p>
<p> Of righteousness reveals its presence not.</p>
<p> For such compassion's bowels ne'er should yearn,</p>
<p> And yet mine eyes behold a handiwork</p>
<p> Which were the offspring but of earnest zeal;</p>
<p> Yet since example's perfect work is done,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[page&nbsp;25]</span>
<p> The pattern to oblivion's shades we'll cast.</p>

<p> So must I cross the Rubicon and strike</p>
<p> The foe in parts most vulnerable.</p>
<p> Caesar, from the deep cavern of his mind,</p>

<p> A plan which we must now inaugurate,</p>

<p> Most honored Francos, I had closed mine ear</p>
<p> But Seldonskip like to a jackass brayed</p>
<p> And I perforce did catch his words distraught,</p>
<p> Which seemed to fling an insult in thy face.</p>
<p> And cast contempt upon our worthy sons.</p>
<p> If concord sweet shall lend us helping hand</p>
<p> I fear me much this yokel must go hence</p>
<p> For he doth gag us with his silly tongue!</p>

<p> Put and say 'tis here? Alas, it like a</p>

<p> Hence it were folly, "Nothing," to pursue.</p>

<p> Like music, as it trickles from thy brain;</p>
<p> But still the wound remains which venomed tongue</p>
<p> Hath deeply stung upon my memory.</p>
<p> But thou hast said: an uttered thought is dead.</p>
<p> Perhaps 'tis so, but in the human heart,</p>
<p> There lingers long a mem'ry, blessed indeed,</p>
<p> Of those preceding us to that long home</p>
<p> Where, be it utter darkness which prevails,</p>
<p> Or light supernal with celestial ray,</p>
<p> Yet death hath not erased from mental scroll</p>
<p> The image which th' Eternal painted there.</p>

<p> Which Caesar to expectant ears did send.</p>
<p> My heart doth overflow, when I recall</p>
<p> The ecstasy that spoke in thunder tones</p>
<p> And like to period rhetorical</p>
<p> Did ever punctuate each proper pause.</p>
<p> Quick did I note in what well ordered ranks</p>
<p> Our party friends did form before the stand.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Quezox:</i> </span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, noble Sire, methought I in each eye</p>

<p> Unless their hungry hopes are satisfied</p>
<p> By wellfilled bellies of official food.</p>
<p> If this discernment doth not truth belie</p>
<p> It points prophetic to a scramble sharp</p>
<p> To wear the cast off shoes of those who now</p>
<p> Do suck the life blood from our downtrod race.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Seldonskip:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;You bet they'll scramble and they'll scramble hard,</p>
<p> An why not tell me? 'Tis all in the game!</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(Francos to Seldonskip):</i></span> Again that tongue, in thoughtless prattle wags.</p>
<p> It seems that every opening of thy mouth,</p>
<p> Doth point to utterance in words uncouth</p>
<p> Which clothe some folly in a tattered garb.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(Quezox to Francos):</i></span> And yet most noble sire, my bowels of</p>
<p> Discernment do fierce gripe me with the fear</p>
<p> That in the rambling words this youth hath tongued</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> &nbsp;Fear not! Caesar hath wise discerned that all</p>

<p> Befool their judgment; which may honest be.</p>
<p> And hence 'twere better from abroad to bring</p>
<p> More open minds to fill important posts</p>
<p> For the brief time until we do depart</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> When, as we tread the varied path of life,</p>
<p> Disaster dire demands a valued limb,</p>
<p> We with the mood of Stoic bear the pain;</p>
<p> While nagging tooth doth ever set us wild.</p>
<p> 'Tis vain on deep philosophy to call</p>
<p> When stinging gnats, unseen, do us assail;</p>
<p> A warring instinct urges us to kill,</p>
<p> And we delay not, till Dame Reason speaks.</p>
<p> 'Twas but an automatic action of the mind</p>
<p> When matter trivial late did rouse a phlegm</p>
<p> Within my soul, which irritated sore,</p>
<p> And on the instant I did stern resolve</p>
<p> That, like the surgeon when an abscess ripe</p>
<p> Action demands with operating knife,</p>
<p> To sever bonds politic which did fast</p>
<p> Within my family executive</p>
<p> Hold Seldonskip and bid him hence to speed.</p>
<p class="i4"> But <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sometinies'">sometimes</ins> action swift doth breed regreet;</p>
<p class="i4"> An as I on the future cogitate,</p>
<p class="i4"> Methinks excuses which might satisfy</p>
<p class="i4"> Uninterested minds may weakly fail</p>
<p class="i4"> To ease paternal irritation, when</p>
<p class="i4"> Its offspring, bearing hence a varnished tale</p>
<p class="i4"> Of wrongs which from imagination's womb</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[page&nbsp;30]</span>
<p class="i4"> Were born and yet with specious sound do ring.</p>
<p class="i4"> Hence I must speedily with subtle skill</p>
<p class="i4"> Frame a dispatch which like to plaster kind</p>
<p class="i4"> May ease the irritation of the sore</p>
<p class="i4"> And thus mar not a happy intercourse.</p>
<p> The mind of man can compass many things,</p>
<p> But still, to reach perfection's dizzy height,</p>
<p> It should be centered on some special point,</p>
<p> Fathered by energy, to reach the goal.</p>
<p> How can I soar, upheld by wings of hope,</p>
<p> When various projects, all demanding skill,</p>
<p> Before me loom, as do the clouds of night</p>
<p> All threat'ning storm which well may wreck the craft</p>
<p> Unless the captain calls unto his aid</p>
<p> Lieutenants by long school of action trained</p>
<p> To guard from danger's shoals which are unknown</p>
<p> Except to those who long the chart have scanned?</p>
<p class="i4"> My predecessor who first ruled these Isles</p>
<p class="i4"> Did loud proclaim in optimistic tones</p>
<p class="i4"> The Philippines for Filipinos are,</p>
<p class="i4"> And so high expectations did arouse</p>
<p class="i4"> Which Time with all its mellowing pow'r did</p>
<p class="i4"> Dissapoint; and so at last Approval's</p>
<p class="i4"> Smile slowly did wane, and bitterest frown,</p>
<p class="i4"> Conceived from discontent, usurped its place.</p>
<p> Alas! Am I to be the pliant tool</p>
<p> To work a policy from chaos born?</p>
<p> And on its failure, if perchance it fails,</p>
<p> Will I too meet the cold and icy stare?</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Enter Halstrom; speaks:</i></span></p>
<p class="i4"> My Liege, thy self-communion I would halt</p>
<p class="i4"> And usher to thy presence men of weight</p>
<p class="i4"> Who would discourse upon some pregnant facts</p>
<p class="i4"> Which may perchance to thee be quite unknown.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Good Halstrom, tell me of their every mien.</p>
<p>(<i>anxiously</i>)</p>
<p> Didst thou in judgment fair, within their eyes</p>
<p> Spy greedy look as if on plunder bent?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[page&nbsp;31]</span>
<p> If so, 'twere best preoccupation plead.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Halstrom:</i></span> I think, my Liege, 'twere safe to give them ear</p>
<p class="i4"> So that offense may rankle not their minds.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Ha, thinkst thou so? Then hail them to my court.</p>
<p> But stay! Wisdom doth hint that in each ear</p>
<p> A caution should be breathed that concise speech</p>
<p> Were best, for pressing matters constant urge.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Halstrom:</i></span> Thy words are uttered but to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bo'">be</ins> obeyed.</p>
<p class="i4"> That time is precious I will firm impart. <i>(Retires</i></p>
<p class="i6"> <i>and ushers the visitors in.)</i></p>
<p class="i4"> Most honored Sire, these gentlement would speak</p>
<p class="i4"> On matters of great import to the state.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Welcome, sweet Gentlement, I greet thee well,</p>
<p> And wait the import of the words ye bring.</p>
<p> I beg thee speedily the burden ease</p>
<p> From off thy overladen minds, that we</p>
<p> May then in converse wise consider well</p>
<p> The various phases of a matter new.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Gentleman:</i></span> Your Honor!&mdash;Please excuse the term, as I</p>
<p> From pleading long before the bar have thus</p>
<p> Familiar with this title grown, and so</p>
<p> From 'tween my lips the word did careless slip.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos (earnestly):</i></span></p>
<p> But honored Sir, I fain would ask what bar</p>
<p> It wast before which thou didst earnest plead?</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Gentlemen:</i></span> Ha! Ha! Methinks a subtle humor finds</p>
<p> Its home within the mind of him who rules.</p>
<p> But in all truth the point were taken well,</p>
<p> For Caesar, rumor saith, disdains the cup</p>
<p> Which doth inebriate and thus befool</p>
<p> The mind of him who at it tarries long.</p>
<p> But Sire, the business which doth urge us here</p>
<p> Is of great import to our party's needs.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> I pray thee, hasten to the point, for time</p>
<p> Hath wings that bear us swiftly on.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Gentleman:</i></span> Most noble Governor, I sore lament</p>
<p> That from our noble South there be men here</p>
<p> Who have deep sympathy for these, who in</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[page&nbsp;32]</span>
<p> The past have fattened at the public crib,</p>
<p> And find no sympathy for Caesar's plan</p>
<p> To mould this commonwealth on model grand</p>
<p> Perfected by the chivalry front which</p>
<p> Both he and thou didst draw sweet childhood's milk.</p>
<p> These men did quick condone the ev'ry act</p>
<p> Which emanated from the Northern mind.</p>
<p> Yearly were millions spent on bootless task</p>
<p> Of feeding vacant minds on useless food</p>
<p> Because unfitted to their various needs.</p>
<p> "A little knowledge is a dang'rous thing"</p>
<p> And doth unfit the plodding mass for toil,</p>
<p> Which is their proper sphere; hence ev'ry thought</p>
<p> Hard thrust within their skulls doth discontent</p>
<p> Engender, and thus far stability</p>
<p> Doth threathen for the ruling class, and so</p>
<p> As in our "Sunny South" the specter grins</p>
<p> Prophetic of grave danger to the State.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> The plea doth fall on sympathetic ears.</p>
<p> Yet Caesar counseled in his parting words</p>
<p> That discord here among our party friends</p>
<p> Would breed distemper if 'twere not ignored.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Both Gentlemen, despondingly:</i></span></p>
<p> Alas! 'Tis so, that we who burdens bore</p>
<p> Are thrust aside when vict'ry crowns our work</p>
<p> And renegades are placed on equal terms</p>
<p> With loyal sons who ne'er a duty shirked.</p>
<p class="i6"> <i>(Exeunt Gentlemen).</i></p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span>  Ah! so it is. Each entity is filled</p>
<p> With selfish impulse which doth ever hide</p>
<p> Justice eternal from its clouded sight</p>
<p> And pigmy self exalt to giant form.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Bonset:</i></span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sire, it were the common lot of man</p>
<p> To seek preferment; and unless he doth,</p>
<p> No other will lift hand to boost him on,</p>
<p> Unless great wealth doth like a magnet draw</p>
<p> Support from those who with a greedy eye</p>
<p> Expect to feel most happy contact with</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[page&nbsp;33]</span>
<p> The shining coin, which doth a lever prove</p>
<p> To pry success from out the voting mob.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span>  But Bonset, see'st thou not that native worth</p>
<p> And mental parts may overtower the gold</p>
<p> And thus perforce attract attention from</p>
<p> The ones who guide their party to success?</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>(Bonset doublingly)</i></span></p>
<p> Perhaps, my Liege. But in the outer hall</p>
<p> A deputation waits to greeting give</p>
<p> And tokens of respectful homage show</p>
<p> On the behalf of Briton's col'ny here.</p>
<p class="i6">      (<i>Enter Quezox</i>)</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span>  But Bonset, list! 'Twere well to let them wait:</p>
<p> To quick respond will lower dignity.</p>
<p> The British mind doth breed a rev'rence deep</p>
<p> For form and etiquette which swift cognition</p>
<p> Might debase, and thus we on their mental</p>
<p> Vision might mayhap but feeble impress</p>
<p> Make as envoys by most noble Caesar sent</p>
<p> To rule these Isles with gravity and state.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Quezox:</i></span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;Most noble Sire! If I might but suggest,</p>

<p> Each sev'ral person as he shall proceed</p>
<p> To pass before thee and his greeting voice,</p>
<p> And when the proper waiting hath an end,</p>
<p> I will speed forth and beck the conclave in.</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Good Quezox, it doth seem the more I grant,</p>
<p> The more dost thou demand. I at thy word</p>

<p> 'Twas done to firm impress on public mind</p>
<p> Thy worth in fields politic, and by this</p>
<p> To expedite our plans which will in time</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Quezox:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;But Sire, the time is short. Soon I must hie</p>

<p> Appealed to those who may dire action take,</p>
<p> And thus belittlement on me bestow?</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Carpen:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;My Liege, 'tis so. From words which from thy mouth</p>

<p> And to their order did make strong appeal.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos:</i></span> Carpen disloyalty to those in pow'r</p>
<p> Shall meet its proper penalty, and they</p>
<p> Who voiced it must forthwith before me come</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Carpen:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll quick despatch a message to their chief,</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Francos &nbsp;(walks the room, soliloquizing):</i></span></p>
<p> Fortune is often kind, and to our hand</p>
<p> A weapon ready forged and sharpened fits.</p>
<p> A strong presentment lurketh in my mind</p>
<p> That she hath now perchance befriended me.</p>
<p> But Carpen, is this chief most proper named?</p>
<p> Its sound implies that blood's his proper food,</p>
<p> And that he sucks it from this people's veins.</p>
<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Carpen:</i></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;I think your voiced suspicions are unjust.</p>

<p><span class="outdent3"><i>Caesar soliloquizing:</i></span></p>
<p> Life is a problem intricate to solve:</p>
<p> With outstretched arms to grasp, we know not what</p>
<p> From out the future hidden by a veil</p>
<p> With woof too dense for eye of man to pierce;</p>
<p> Yet doth imagination pictures forms</p>
<p> Which, when we would embrace, evade our touch</p>
<p> And vanish into nothingness; while still</p>
<p> We vain pursuit ever persistent make.</p>
<p class="i2"> Euclid from chaos order did evolve</p>
<p class="i2"> And on the scroll of Fame hath writ those laws</p>
<p class="i2"> Which Time, relentless, ne'er can thence efface.</p>
<p class="i2"> For Truth, immutable, is there entombed.</p>
<p class="i2"> But he, in flawless mental armor robed,</p>
<p class="i2"> Did crusade make where Science hath her home,</p>
<p class="i2"> And from her vaults where Truth was close entombed</p>
<p class="i2"> He raped their locks and brought the treasure forth.</p>
<p> Long mankind groped in darkness, nor did dream</p>
<p> That laws harmonious could measure space</p>
<p> And count the cycles that should hail return</p>
<p> Of each recurring comet on its round.</p>
<p> Thus deep uncertainty enrobeth man:</p>
<p> He comes like morning bringing with him light;</p>
<p> He goes like evening, ent'ring portals dark</p>
<p> Where none can track him to his final doom</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[page&nbsp;48]</span>
<p> And know that Immortality's kind arms</p>
<p> Shall hug him to her breast and bear him on</p>
<p> To Fields whose verdure wears a brighter hue,</p>
<p> Or whether Entity shall on the wings</p>
<p> Of fickle Fate be borne to final rest,</p>
<p> Who shall the mystery <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ef'">of</ins> being solve?</p>
<p class="i2"> We see the birdling break from prison shell</p>
<p class="i2"> And dream that we have found the source of life.</p>
<p class="i2"> Vain thought! the egg were but a cunning mask</p>
<p class="i2"> Which Nature wears to hide her handiwork.</p>
<p> The spark electric issues from its cell</p>
<p> Clothed with a pow'r the jealous gods might crave;</p>
<p> But when or how it entity conceived,</p>
<p> Is hid within creation's caverns deep.</p>
<p class="i2"> Now, in the realm of pow'r politic, reigns</p>
<p class="i2"> The God of Chaos anchor'd to his throne,</p>
<p class="i2"> And it remains for one of giant mind,</p>
<p class="i2"> Well disciplined in all scholastic lore,</p>
<p class="i2"> To break the chains which hold that anchor fast,</p>
<p class="i2"> And crush the Pow'r disordered seated there.</p>
<p> Am I the instrument designed by Fate</p>
<p> To, Euclid-like, from this anarchic whole</p>
<p> Evolve the laws which shall Disorder deep</p>
<p> Within the grave entomb and on that throne</p>
<p> The God of Order seat, and in his hand</p>
<p> Imperial scepter place, to rule the world</p>
<p> Politic, as it on its axis rolls,</p>
<p> Unharmed by venomed darts of turpitude?</p>
<p class="i2"> I dreamed of formulating certain laws</p>
<p class="i2"> Which economic matters would control.</p>
<p class="i2"> The midnight lamp, companion of my toil,</p>
<p class="i2"> Has burned in vain. Alas, I see it now.</p>
<p class="i2"> When the great "Commoner," of wisdom full,</p>
<p> A plank within our platform did insert</p>
<p> That our good ships which coastwise trade would ply</p>
<p> Should float as free as sea-gull on the wing</p>

<p> Which links Pacific's waters to the Gulf,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[page&nbsp;49]</span>
<p> I, fool-like, did him earnestly applaud!</p>
<p> Again my soul in bitterness doth surge</p>
<p> Because from distant Isles the lightning brings</p>
<p> Dire words of sour complaint from either clan,</p>
<p> Which like to gladiators in the ring</p>
<p> Seem but prepared to battle to the death.</p>
<p class="i2"> I listened to the frail but honeyed words</p>
<p class="i2"> Of one who held a judgeship in that clime,</p>
<p class="i2"> Only to find disgruntlement their source;</p>
<p class="i2"> And now it shames me, who have been cock-sure,</p>
<p class="i2"> That I should failure see emblazoned there.</p>
<p class="i2"> How could I prudence thus have cast aside</p>
<p class="i2"> And now my stomach fill with humble pie?</p>

<p class="i4"> A wise man in the past hath shrewdly said,</p>
<p class="i4"> Knowing full well that when one's thoughts are paged</p>
<p class="i4"> They like foul spirits menace peace of mind.</p>
<p> Alas! 'tis so, when tongue shall like a bird</p>
<p> Take wing, soaring aloft, and as the wind</p>
<p> Fly aimless over mountain, hill and dale,</p>
<p> Until tired nature doth demand repose,</p>
<p class="i4"> Why did I Roosevelt as a pattern take</p>
<p class="i4"> And boast his doctrines as the wisdom's fount</p>
<p class="i4"> From which I drank as a disciple might</p>
<p class="i4"> Who worships blindly at his idol's shrine?</p>
<p> And now these varlets point with taunting grin</p>
<p> At what my demigod hath ordered here,</p>
<p> And oh, ye sages, what shall I reply?</p>
<p> For now his work I purpose to undo.</p>
<p class="i4"> When I with eloquence did picture draw</p>
<p class="i4"> Of tyranny which from above did flow,</p>
<p class="i4"> And with convincing tongue did loud proclaim</p>
<p class="i4"> That pow'r should ever from below take root;</p>
<p class="i4"> I little dreamed that subtle minds would carp</p>
<p class="i4"> And inconsistency against me charge</p>
<p class="i4"> For earnest effort which eventuates</p>
<p class="i4"> In placing pow'r within the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'erafty'">crafty</ins> hands</p>
<p class="i4"> Of those who long have under Spanish rule</p>
<p class="i4"> Imbibed the time clad notion that the few</p>
<p class="i4"> Who by the accident of happy birth,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[page&nbsp;54]</span>
<p class="i4"> May make a gold mine of the hapless poor.</p>
<p> They voice in cutting words that I who late</p>
<p> Have cast my lot in these downtrodden Isles</p>
<p> Should study well conditions e'er I speak</p>
<p> As cock-sure as a teacher to his class.</p>
<p class="i4"> I, in triumphant tone, did voice the truth</p>
<p class="i4"> That in our homeland stinking graft prevails,</p>
<p class="i4"> But, ah! I overlook the damning fact</p>
<p class="i4"> That ignorance among our foreign born</p>
<p class="i4"> Hath been the hotbed whence this thistle grew,</p>
<p class="i4"> And that our Governor did get his boost</p>
<p class="i4"> Into the forum through that rotten host</p>
<p class="i4"> Which proudly boasts a "Tammany" as its god.</p>
<p> And do the people of our Empire State</p>
<p> Evolve the doctrine which I loud proclaimed?</p>
<p> No! in the dire extremity they laid</p>
<p> Restraining hand upon the venal mob,</p>
<p> Sternly refusing "what they know they want"</p>
<p class="i2"> But now strong opposition draws the veil,</p>
<p> And I behold, to me, the starting fact,</p>
<p> That human minds oft vain illusions hug</p>
<p> Which time alone hath pow'r that grasp to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'looso'">loose</ins>;</p>
<p> And only then through friction with the world</p>
<p> Will freedom from provincial slavery</p>
<p> And mental lassitude be e'er attained.</p>
<p class="i2"> When I my glorious deeds with savage tribes</p>
<p> Did iterate before the gaping throng,</p>
<p> It seemed to me as to the schoolboy raw</p>
<p> That ne'er before had such superb exploits</p>
<p> E'er been achieved by knightly mortal man.</p>
<p> But now 'tis said my predecessor wrought</p>
<p> Like <ins title="Transcriber's Note: sic: 'wonders'?">wounders</ins> in a less ostentious way</p>
<p> And mine are but a copy of his acts.</p>
<p> Within my brain indeed are many wheels</p>
<p> That heretofore have whirled me into place,</p>
<p> But they ne'er buzzed the fact that in these Isles</p>
<p> Abode Americans who dare <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'io'">to</ins> speak</p>
<p> In plain derision of officials high;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[page&nbsp;55]</span>
<p> Forsooth, I dreamed they at the public trough</p>
<p> Did feed; but, lo! an army, small but brave,</p>
<p> Hath thrown its skirmishers into the field</p>
<p> And offered battle with a cold disdain</p>
<p> That maketh chills <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rund'">run</ins> down my weakening spine</p>
<p> And causeth question whether my defy</p>
<p> Was born from Wisdom's or from Folly's womb.</p>
<p> Quick in my logic's dome where thought doth dwell</p>
<p> Those wheels whirled out these brilliant, burning words:</p>
<p> "These varlets have no place within these Isles</p>
<p> And quick should speed them to their native land;"</p>
<p> But <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'men'ry'">mem'ry</ins> doth recall the "pine-tree" wilds</p>

<p> Only to later bid me wander forth</p>

<p class="i4"> Indeed, it seems that in man dwells a force</p>
<p class="i4"> That doth impel <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'adverturc'">adventure</ins> from the spot</p>

<p> A victory indeed of doubtful cast.</p>
<p class="i2"> But to our joy affix a deep regret,</p>
<p class="i2"> For that proud list of eighty warring knights</p>
<p class="i2"> Who fell with faces always to the front</p>
<p class="i2"> Yet ready stand to wage anew the fight</p>
<p class="i2"> Whene'er their ears close to their mother earth</p>
<p class="i2"> Shall hear the call to office once again.</p>
<p class="i12">         (<i>Reflectively.</i>)</p>
<p>For once a politician wins the race,</p>
<p>He like an warhorse smells the battle far</p>
<p>And to his dying day doth live in hope</p>
<p>That grateful country may make its demand.</p>
<p><span class="outdent1">(<i>Close by singing an ode to the air;</i></span></p>
<p class="i2"><i>"Hark, from the Tomb a Doleful Sound"</i>)</p>
<p>Sleep! martyrs, sleep! till resurrection morn,</p>
<p class="i2">When sounding trump shall call to office sweet;</p>
<p>Republicans may grin with silent scorn,</p>
<p class="i2">But we like hungry pigs still smell the teat.</p>

<h4>Transcriber's Note (continued), and Errata</h4>


<h5>Transcriber's Note:</h5>
<p>
There has been a suggestion that this book may have been
self-published; the style and layout are not necessarily consistent.
Some of the round brackets (stage directions) are italicised, along
with their contents; others are not. Different fonts were used for
headings, and there were two instances of letters which were not the same font
or size as the other letters in the respective word. There was even one letter 'o' which
appeared to be upside down, or, perhaps, a mirror-image.</p>




<h5>Errata - old typos:</h5>

<p>Obvious punctuation errors have been repaired.</p>

<p>The remaining corrections made are indicated by dotted lines under the corrections.
Scroll the mouse over the word and the original text will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'apprear'">appear</ins>.</p>
